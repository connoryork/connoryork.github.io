### Introduction
Hello, my name is Connor York and this is my website! I am a software engineer graduating with a degree in Computer Science from RIT in **December 2019**.
### Purpose
Hosted by GitHub using Jekyll, I created this for fun and because it is _free_. I figure I can use this for keeping all of my professional things in one place, such as my projects, my resume, and my LinkedIn/GitHub.

The blog portion will be a sort of accountability partner when it comes to working on personal projects!
